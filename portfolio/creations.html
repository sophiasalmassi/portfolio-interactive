			   <h3>Cafe Drawing Using Aquarell</h3>
			   <p>Inspo: Simple and messy Cafe/Boulangerie.<br>I was inspired by the south of France style of cafes that you can find while you walk in Provence.</p>

			   <h3>Flower Vase Drawing Using Aquarell</h3>
			   <p>Inspo: All the flower bouquets we have at our house inspired me to draw this vase with flowers in it.</p>

			   <h3>Shadow and Vases</h3>
			   <p>Inspo: I wanted to try different technics of drawing such as the crayon. It wasn't very easy to draw this as the proportions weren't correct, the perspective was difficult to perfect and it was hard to fade in the crayon.

    <h3>Beauty of Iran</h3>
			   <p>Inspo: A return to my origines during the holidays allowed me to rediscover Iran from a new point of vue that is in fact completely different from what we see on TV. Unfortunatly it is not often promoted by the medias. </p>

			   <h3>Une Passion Pour Les Gateaux</h3>
			   <p>Inspo: The only photo I have of a cake I made for my sister's birthday.
My idea was to make her an unusual cake, something she had never had.
I then had the idea of ​​making a "crepe cake", a style of cake that had become known thanks to the influence of the internet.
It's a cake with about twenty layers of crepe covered with whipped cream and a chocolate ganache.</p>

			   <h3>Affiche Election CVL</h3>
			   <p>Inspo: The goal was to create a poster as part of the elections for the high school life council. The idea behind my poster was to do something simple yet catchy for high school students. I then, added symbols of things that we promote such as ecology, recycling, gender equality and lgbtq.
For the colors I chose beige because it gives a sober and simple effect and the color white would pop and stand out as well as for the other images that i added on top. In addition, I wanted to make my poster as a reminder of school by adding paper style images. I wanted to create something easy to see, which is eye-catching but also simple and summerizing in note format which, again, reminds of school.</p>

    <h3>Screenshot Of My Code Lines</h3>
			   <p>Inspo:  The idea for my site, which is also the main part of my artistic creations,
came to me while I was looking at the third year program at Strate which offers courses in CSS and HTML.
Indeed I had the opportunity in high school in court of SNT to create a site in HTML and CSS which then developed my taste for these languages ​​and new technologies.
So I decided to create this site by registering it as part of an artistic creation but which will also include other creations that I had the opportunity to do.</p>
